# Risk Game

#### Hello and welcome to my attempt at re-creating the board game *Risk: Global Domination*, as the name may suggest, the goal is to take over the world by controlling as many regions as possible!
#### Defeat your enemies in the form of AIs in the game, or others sitting beside you!
#### You will strategise and take risks, with realtime calculated probabilities informing you of your odds of winning a battle, so you can decide whether or not to take it!
